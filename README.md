## Citibike Analysis

This study is in response to Challenge 18, Tableau Analysis of the Citi-Bike Data.
The aim of this study is to focus on CitiBike journeys that originate from Jersey City (JC).
JC is very close to Manhatten Island, New York City but is separated by the Hudson River. There are two crossing points.
This physical barrier reresents a potential factor in the use of Citibikes. 
It is the purpose of this study to answer the following questions:

What is the seasonal variation in the use of citbikes between January 2022 and July 2022?

What is the breakdown in both member versus casual usage as well as a comparison between classic and electric cycle usage?

What is the relationship between the distance and time taken for the trips taken in summer?

What are the destination stations used in winter and summer for trips from Jersey City to NYC?
